## Hinder - Tinder for Houses. Match with your dream house. Real Estate Made Easy

### Hinder - The Poem (Courtesy of ChatGPT)

In a world where choices reign supreme,
In the land of digital dreams,
There came an app, oh so bold,
Hinder, it was called, for homes bought and sold.

Swipe left for no, swipe right for yes,
A modern dance in the real estate quest.
With each flick, a destiny's steered,
In this whimsical world, where homes are revered.

In the heart of the city or the calm of the 'burbs,
Each swipe brings forth houses, unobserved.
Mansions grand with gates and towers,
Cozy cottages hidden amidst flowers.

Swipe to the left, a mansion so grand,
Too vast, too cold, not what you had planned.
Swipe to the right, a cottage so small,
Its ivy-clad walls, to your heart, call.

The dance goes on, day and night,
Under the moon's soft, glowing light.
Each house with a story, each room with a tale,
In the world of Hinder, let your heart set sail.

"Too modern, too quaint," so the judgments fly,
As houses and dreams before your eyes glide by.
From loft apartments to bungalows quaint,
Each swipe, a brushstroke, a homeowner's paint.

In this carousel of homes and dreams,
Where nothing's quite as it seems,
Hinder, the app, holds the key,
To a home, a life, where you're meant to be.

Yet, amidst this whimsical chase,
Remember, a home's more than a space.
It's where love dwells, where hearts are kind,
A haven of peace, for body and mind.

So swipe with care, swipe with heart,
In this digital bazaar, where dreams start.
For a house is mere brick, stone, and wood,
But a home is where you're understood.

In Hinder's realm, may you find,
A dwelling that reflects your mind.
A place of comfort, joy, and mirth,
A little corner on this Earth.

So here's to Hinder, Tinder for homes,
In this digital age where our fancy roams.
May each swipe bring you closer to,
A home that's perfect, just for you.
